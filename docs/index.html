                        can be, and opening my students' eyes to a new world by helping them learn English.

                    <h3>A Learner-Centered Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        I believe that figuring out your students interests and incorporating them into your lesson
                        plans, without coming off as a try-hard, is the best way to peek their interest and encourage
                        them to participate in class. I also believe that a teacher shouldn't just be a person who
                        stands in front of a black board but also life guide for his students, and a person they can
                        come and talk to about things they wouldn't otherwise share with other people that is why
                        respect and appreciation should be mutually communicated in class.

                                In Business, they say that you either earn or learn. I think that is applicable to every

                        I never had any experience teaching English in a formal setting prior to this. It was
                        nerve-wrecking at first but I got into the flow of it after a minute or two.

                    <p>
                        The lesson went well, and I enjoyed doing it. I got feedback from my peers and instructing
                        Professor which encouraged me to improve and become better

                        <h3>My Evaluation of the TESOL Training Program</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was reluctant to join the program in the beginning but it turned out to be a very nice experience. Here are some of the main
                            pros and cons:
                        </p>

                                <h4>✅ Pros:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Good Trainers</strong> – This is the first time I encountered trainers
                                         who seemed to know their craft really well. They are also the best English teachers 
                                         I've ever had.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Supportive Environment</strong> – Both trainers and peers were very nice and friendly.
                                        I never felt comfortable talking around people in any other situation like I did during this
                                        program.

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Assignements</strong> – Some online assignements were repeated multiple times which confused me. 
                                        Others didn't have correct answers listed for them when I went to check my scores.
